# ITClickPro Public Repo
This repo is a compilation of scripts I have compiled during my years as an IT Administrator.
Some of the scripts were created from scratch and some others use another script as a base, but modify it to make it hopefully better.

Make sure you understand what the script does and make the necessary changes before using them.

# Folders Structure
Below is a short explanation of what you may find in each folder:

## Intune folder
Scripts designed to be deployed via intune for Windows and MacOS devices, most if not all have already been used in production environments so they have been tested.

## PowerShell
These scripts have been used mainly for OS Deployment during projects I did with MS SCCM, others were used to fix issues on Windows devices, I tried to add as much comments as I could so it makes it easier to understand.

## Batch - Windows 
These scripts have also been collected from different sources and have been already tested and used for IT support porpuses, but as usual make sure you test it before using it in production.
